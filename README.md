# CS 4331/5331 Project 3 Proposal
### _"Exploring the Solar System"_

## Team Members:
1. Amitsingh Paredeshi
2. Jonatha Bouligny
3. Prerit Datta

### Aim of the Project
The intent of the project is to educate the children about our Solar system. The children would be able to interact and gain more information about the planets. The app will allow the user to "visit" the planet, have a "feel" of the atmosphere on that particular planet, while at the same time gaining useful information like its _mass, temperature, gravity, length of the day, number of moons (if any)_ etc.

### Hardware Platform to be used
We wish to create a VR app using *Unity3D* for __Oculus Touch__. Oculus offers a more interactive and immersive experience than the Google Cardboard and thus was the unianimous choice of the group. Unity's rich set of features and C# scripts enables a useful application development.

### Link to Libraries/Assets
We intend to gather information from scientific sources like [NASA](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/) and use other resouces such as **Unity Asset Store** or Textures.com. We'll update the README as we progress towards the development of the project.
